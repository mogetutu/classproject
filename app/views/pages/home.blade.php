	 <h2> START UP ACROSS AFRICA</h2>

<p class="p2">The Nairobi Garage is one of 3 co-working tech hubs in Africa – There are also Garages in Cape Town and Lagos. Our vision is for Africa to be a power-house of tech, innovation and entrepreneurship, and our hubs are home to those making that happen. By providing affordable, flexible office space, the Garages allow companies to focus on what is important – growing their business. We do more than provide a practical and effective office solution – we create the environment for young businesses to build networks, share ideas and collaborate on new projects. The Garages are the go-to places for entrepreneurship, investment and tech in Africa.</p>
